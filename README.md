**Stock Price Prediction using LSTM**

This project uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The model is trained on stock prices (e.g., Google) to forecast future values.

**Key Features:**
Data Preprocessing: Clean, scale, and split data into training and testing sets.
LSTM Model: Build and train an LSTM model to forecast stock prices.
Prediction & Visualization: Compare predicted prices with actual values and visualize the results.

**Technologies:**
Python
TensorFlow/Keras
Matplotlib/Seaborn
scikit-learn
This project demonstrates time series forecasting using LSTM for stock price prediction.
